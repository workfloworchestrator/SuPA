# Part of the installation process is the generation of Python code from protobuf/gRPC definitions.
# For that we need to have `grpcio-tools` around *before* `setup.py` is executed. The version number of `grpcio-tools`
# should match that of `grpcio` in `setup.cfg`. Actual code generation is done from within `setup.py` in a custom
# Command class.
