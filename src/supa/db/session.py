"""Setup the DB, configure SQLAlchemy and define the schema.

Due to SuPA's modest DB requirements we have chosen to use `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/index.html>`_.
It is very easy to use,
does not require a full client/server setup,
and it is wickedly fast.
There are some limitations with regards to concurrency,
but those will not affect SuPA with its low DB WRITE needs;
especially when configured with the :attr:`~supa.JournalMode.WAL` journal mode.

Usage
=====

.. warning:: Due to how SuPA initializes itself,
             whatever needs to be imported from this module,
             needs to be imported locally!

When anything from this module is imported at the top of other modules
some things within this module might not yet have been correctly initialized.
Most notable the location of the SQLite database file.
Once the initialization has been completed,
these already imported objects will still refer to the old uninitialized ones.
Don't worry too much about it;
you will get an informative error.
But just to be on the safe side,
always import anything from this module locally!
