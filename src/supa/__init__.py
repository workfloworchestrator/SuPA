    Without WAL,

    SQLite locks the entire database as soon as a transaction starts.
    As SuPA also uses SQLAlchemy,
    that happens to issue a transaction upon session creation,
    this could have a negative performance impact.

    However, :attr:`WAL` journal mode does not work well with networked file systems,

    This might also hold for some, or most of the Kubernetes storage volumes.
