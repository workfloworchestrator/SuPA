"""Define the three NSI Connection Service state machines.

The NSI Connection Service defines three state machines that,
together with the message processing functions (=coordinator functions in NSI parlance),
model the behaviour of the protocol.

They are:

- :class:`ReservationStateMachine` (RSM)
- :class:`ProvisionStateMachine` (PSM)
- :class:`LifecycleStateMachine` (LSM)

The state machines explicitly regulate the sequence in which messages are processed.
The CS messages are each assigned to one of the three state machines:
RSM, PSM and LSM.
When the first reserve request for a new Connection is received,
the function processing the reserve requests MUST coordinate the creation of the
RSM, PSM and LSM
state machines for that specific connection.

The RSM and LSM MUST be instantiated as soon as the first Connection request is received.

The PSM MUST be instantiated as soon as the first version of the reservation is committed.
